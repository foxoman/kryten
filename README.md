Kryten is a CLI tool to help you easily ask questions and get clear
sourced answers directly from your documents.

Call it through your shell, give it a filepath, and ask a question.

You will get a nice answer, and a nice source citation telling you where
that answer came from.

### Goals:

Kryten is portable, snappy, and works across all platforms with
minimal resource usage. For real.

- **CLI only**
- SQLite for portability and easy backups.
- Ask any question you want.
- Show your chat history for a single file.
- Show your chat history across all files.
- Documents are cached so questions are snappy.
- Run without ceremony. No need for configurations.

### Usage Guide:

You need two things for Kryten to be able to work:

- An OpenAI API key.
- A Pinecone.io vector database.
